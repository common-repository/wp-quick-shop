WP Quick Shop is a WooCommerce compatible plugin which enables you to setup a one-page shop for items to sell in bulk. You can add notes for each order item with custom field. WP Quick Shop can be implemented with just a shortcode. Create a page and paste shortcode. On Quick Shop page you can set quantity of items and use add to cart feature instantly. Every item is provided with a button to buy that item individually. Custom field will be saved with order details. Select Custom Field tab and enabled it. You can set custom field type like textarea, text and number. Column heading, field placeholder, tooltip and max length of field can be managed as well. Some styles are available for free and you can add your custom styles as well. Bootstrap is a premium feature as it will involve some complications with your theme templates and you might will require support from us later.
